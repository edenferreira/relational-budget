- if you have the same name representing the same thing, like ::account/name in entry and account, it may seem weird at first but when you start to join, union, select, project, etc, it makes a lot more sense.
  - If they are the same thing having the same name simplify things
- is the domain a definition for production or for test? I'm inclined to think test, and documentation, but not running time
